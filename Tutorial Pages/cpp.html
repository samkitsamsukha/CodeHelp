    <h2 id="q">What is C++?</h2>
    <p>
        C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that's often praised for its efficiency and performance. It's an extension of the C programming language and incorporates object-oriented programming (OOP) features. C++ allows developers to write code that can directly interact with hardware, making it suitable for system-level programming, such as operating systems or device drivers.
        <br>C++ is widely used in various domains such as game development, where its speed and ability to manage system resources efficiently are crucial. It's also prevalent in fields like finance, embedded systems, scientific research, and building high-performance software where control over hardware and memory is essential.The language continues to evolve with each new standard, introducing modern features while maintaining backward compatibility. C++ remains a fundamental language in the realm of programming due to its power, performance, and versatility across a wide range of applications.
