    <h2 id="q">What is Python?</h2>
    <p>

        Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive
        community support. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability
        and productivity. Its syntax allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like
        C++ or Java, promoting a clean and maintainable codebase. Python is dynamically typed and supports multiple
        programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Widely used for web
        development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more, Python's extensive standard library
        and third-party packages contribute to its popularity. The language's versatility, ease of learning, and broad
        applicability make it a preferred choice for beginners and seasoned developers alike in a diverse range of
        industries.

        <p>The sequence Data Type in Python is the ordered collection of similar or different data
            types. Sequences allow storing of multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion.
            There are several sequence types in Python –</p>

                    and negative indexing. The 0th element will be the first character of the string whereas the -
